            <p>Our education system must evolve to keep pace with mighty changes occurring today in business, industry, and society. Students must develop attributes and knowledge beyound traditional constraints of the classroom. Education System must be designed to accommodate current trends and future needs. It must create more connections and stronger partnership with the global society in which we are embedded. Our goal is to articulate the role of education in the early part of the 21st century and to establish design specifications that will enable our students to be a leader in shaping the future of the world. As such we have an obligation to address the full range of higher eduction, namely: teaching and learning, research, and service to the community. Indeed these three elements must be totally integrated if we are able to be effective in the pursuit of our mission.</p>
